# Report - September 10th #

## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned ##
Concepts:
- Creating a new Unreal project
- Adding actors into environment
- Customizing actors and converting to re-usable blueprints
- Simple terrain generation

Activities:
I downloaded and installed the Unreal Engine. Then, I completed the entirety of the built-in tutorials in the First-Person project. Using those, I was able to customize the small map they provided, add terrain (with different heights), and create re-usable "actors", which is their term for most blocks. Most of this was done visually, but I also briefly went through how to create actors in C++. 

## Issues/Problems
- Ran out of space on C drive, quick fix to mvoe to F
- had to install new .NET architecture
- I don't know C++ very well
- The process of importing and creating Megascans is foreign to me, for the moment. 
^Nothing big :)

## Plans
- First and foremost, a crash course on C++ is in order
- Following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATX7kmET4zE&list=PLUTAwZqzGLD9TLT9uBTD8V4_36EhhxFd-&index=2&t=0s&ab_channel=Quixel) should give me the basics of how to generate photorealistic terrain
    - I'll have to account for extra time here in case I need to take a deeper dive into any of the components they're using, which seems likely.
- There's also a great course [on making hyper-realistic outdoor environments in Unreal Engine](https://www.udemy.com/course/make-photorealistic-outdoor-environment-in-unreal-engine-daniel-krafft/) which I would love to take, but is more expensive - maybe if the lab has a budget?
- Speak w Prof re creating a plan of acton for the semester (and really, clarifying my role on the team)
