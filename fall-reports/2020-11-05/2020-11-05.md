# Report - October 29th #

## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned ##
- implemented time logging from Blueprint
- implemented system to allow for directional logging



### Concepts:
- DateTime and Timecode objects in Unreal
- Scripting in Python
- Hard drives & PC modifications

### Activities:
- I worked on getting the timestamp logging to work in Unreal Engine. 
    - I started out first by just using the library I installed last week to print strings to a file. At first, I could only do it from a dedicated button, which was the same as the one that logged a screenshot. It printed a timestamp to another file, which will help when organizing the images.

    - at first, I couldn't figure out how to connect the datetime object to the function that would create a string. It also took me a bit to find out about the "now" function, which printed current time. I first was struggling to do it by declaring a new datetime object myself. I then did some more research and found that there was a separate Timecode object.

    - the above was fine at first, but eventually, we'll need other input as well, like which button was pressed. I had to really do some research here, because in-engine documentation isn't great - I couldn't find the nodes I needed, even though I was sure they had to be there. Finally, I was able to declare a variable and update it with information about which button was pressed, and print that to a file.
    - the last issue I faced is that the axis keys continually take input, which meant that my screenshots were continually being taken. It was taking way too much space on my computer, and worse, slowing everything down to a screeching halt. I had to devise a system to track which was the last button pressed, and only take a new screenshot when a different button was pressed this time than last time. Here's the finished product:

- I also implemented a script that would organize the screenshots and strings into one csv.
    - I had to learn a bit about how csv's work in python. Also, how to use the PIL library. But actually, I ended up taking a shortcut instead of finding out how to get the filename, since I knew what the naming structure was like. 
    - Here's the final results:

    And the code that created it:

- I researched some potential hard drives to switch out on my machine:

## Issues/Problems
- no big issues this week! Small memory management tasks and lot of research on the libraries I was using, especially with Unreal.

## Plans
- I think at this point, the infrastructure is there! Next week I'll:
    - Finish up the key logging in unreal
    - Coordinate with Jared to see what info he needs on each image
    - Recreate Edmunds Ballroom or something similar so we can start training the model!
