# Report - October 29th #

## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned ##
- Read about PixelForest and decided against using it for the moment
- Set up Airsim and read the documentation for use in our models



### Concepts:
- using Airsim and associated APIs
- using Unreal libraries
- Printing to file


### Activities:
- I read through some forums for PixelForest, but the problem is that
the developers said back in April 2019 that it had no export functionality,
and really haven't been answering questions since. Because their reasoning
was that they would release that functionality if the game became more popular, 
and it hasn't, I don't have high hopes. It seems the product is meant to be a
game more than developer tools.
- I spent a lot of time working on Airsim. The details are down in Issues, but the gist is that I think I'll stick to my own project on Unreal, both for mine and my hard drive's sanity. 
- I spent some more time searching through Unreal Forums to find a good library to use and finally found one - [Rama's Extra Blueprint Nodes]()
    - [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr87zPbki_4&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=SahkanISR) a quick tutorial on how to install that
    - note that if it's a blueprint class like mine, you can literally just make a new folder called "Plugins" (case sensitive) inside your project and paste it in there, then rebuild.
- I was finally able to print to a file!

I had to do some tweaking so it would allow me to append to the file instead of creating a new one each time, but that was easy enough. There's also funcitonality to write an array to the file, and to create that array in memory, which might be useful, so I spent some time learning about that. 



## Issues/Problems
- I tried to install Airsim and had a LOT of trouble with that. One of the main
issues is that my machine just didn't have the storage on C drive, which 
Visual Studio strongly recommended to be installed in. Even when I did manage to
clear up the space, it didn't work because my Airsim folder was in a different
drive, so I had to uninstall and reinstall a couple times.
- There were so many differnet little components that went into airsim that it
became a slog through tutorials to get everything set up. There were so many that
I'll just make that its own section - should also help any future students working
on this.
- I'm skeptical of Airsim, both because the level of effort to set up will make it 
hard to get multiple people training the model, and because the vehicles it has are
less similar to ours. After a couple hours trying to get it to work, I'm switching back to my own Unreal proejct to see if I can just set up the printing to a text
file functionality. If so, it wil be much easier to set up that way, since I've 
already done most of the work for it. 
- Airsim takes a LOT of resources on my computer, so I wasn't able to take screenshots
this time (it will crash the moment I open up the clipping tool). I'm excited to show everyone during the meeting, however!

## Tutorials
- [Building on Windows](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/build_windows/)
- [Playing in Unreal](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/unreal_proj/)
- [Setting up Remote Controls](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/remote_control/)
    - note that it won't work without some sort of RC. I tried and failed ot use 
    my keyboard
    - [Setting up an xbox controller, specifically](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/xbox_controller/)
    - [Setting up QGroundControl](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html)
        - you'll need this to set up the xbox controller as a remote control to airsim. I'm honestly still not sure why
- [Using image APIs](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/image_apis/)


## Plans
- now that I've got printing to a file working and know which direction I'm taking in unreal, I think my next steps are pretty simple:
    - affix each of the cardinal directions with a screenshot and a print to file node
    - off of Unreal, write a script to combine the contents of the txt file I produce with the name of the image, in like a csv
- with the above, we should be able to start collecting data to train a model
- after that base functionality is set , I'll start making some small improvements to the Unreal project. Namely:
    - add flight to the rover (probably in small bursts)
    - start simulating the real environments (like Edmunds Hall)
    - coordinate w Jared to figure out exactly how he'd like the pictures
