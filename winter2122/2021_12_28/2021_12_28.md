# Report - Dec 28, 2021#

## Agenda ##
- Create a testing suite for Animat; use it as an opportunity to plan a better architecture

## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned ##
Concepts:
- Test Driven Development

Activities:
- Created a full testing suite for the new animat file (animat2). This is to aim for a fresh start in creating a functioning animat.

Achievements:
- Finished testing suite
    - planned new method for organization of leg / actor coordination
    - planned new system for organizing and getting data from leg movements





## Issues/Problems
- None so far, except I've got quite the list of modifications to make:
    - animat now takes much fewer arguments, more things have to be passed in after the fact, to allow for re-using the same animat
    - legs will no longer move simultaneously. instead, one at a time will be made to move to their current sub-goal. that leg will then report information to the app, and animat will move the next leg. this should allow for real-time simulation
    - on that note, leg goals will no longer be assigned one at a time. instead, all sub-goals will be calculated at the first total goal assignment to animat. 

## Plans for next session
- begin implementing a new animat class
