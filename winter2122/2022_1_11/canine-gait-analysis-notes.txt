Forelimb lameness
- head goes up when lame forelimb goes down
    - hindlimbs may also appear tucked under (& back is arched)
- shoulder lameness -> short stride

Hindlimb lameness:
- weight shifted "cranially" = close to head
- forlimbs placed further back ("caudally"), head stretched out, 
    to push center gravity further out

Gaits Table:
- walk is the only one with 3 planted feet; we should be prepared
for more gaits that have feet lifted and stepping
- trot is the only one with true suspension; at odds with the gait file
i wrote, which also has canter with suspension. need to fix!
- the gallops are all based on spine flexing, not feet lifting necessarily.
how do we handle this in our current system? do we even bother with it
for the moment? we could just move the legs forward without upward movement?

Figure 2
- back leg has 3 segments, front has 4. should adjust model?

Kinetic gait analysis
- seems like the 2nd most useful section after the table. range of motion
is what we've been working on recently, but there's no info on what the correct
amount is, and it specifically says it varies by breed. Maybe our file will have to
include info about what the range of motion should be? Unsure if we can represent
that or if we should just stick to a generic model.
