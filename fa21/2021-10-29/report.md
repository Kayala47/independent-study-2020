# Report - Week of Oct 29, 2021#

## Activities/Accomplishments,  and Concepts/Lessons Learned 


### Activites & Accomplishments
- created proposed architecture document for my attempt at gaitpt
- began coding the designed architecture

I think the architecture doc explains it in much more detail, but I basically brainstormed using gait as the building block. I'm hoping to build up from an implementation of a gait object, but still struggling with the exact details. 



## Issues/Problems
- No serious issues. Coming up with ideas was hard, coming up with an architecture better than prof's even more so. I think I've done a good job of at least coming at it from a different direction. Hopefully feedback will be good :)



## Plans for next week
- Continue implementing the rest of the codebase for gaitpt. Think hard about what level of scalability we meet. Tomorrow's meeting should clear up some questions.
