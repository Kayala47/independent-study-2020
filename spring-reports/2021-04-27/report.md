## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned ##


### Concepts:
- Conference decisions
- Related works
- Moving an actor in Unreal

### Accomplishments:
- Found three potential conferences to submit to
- Created a graph of related works and added a few of the closest to the doc


## Activities:
I looked at some conferences we could submit to. It looks like Jared beat me to the closest, but I was able to find a few that we can submit this summer and then present by the end of the year. Hopefully that's not too bad! There were a couple disappointing ones that looked really cool but had already passed. 

I wasn't sure what to say for the quality of each of these conferences - i'm not sure where those metrics would come from. I tried to stick to the ones that explicitly said "international" when they were not in the US as much as possible. Also read through a couple and decided not to include because they weren't our research area specifically. Hope that's ok! I recognize I don't have much experience here so let me know if I should just include available conferences indiscriminately.

For the papers, I tried to just read the abstract and summarize that in our google doc. I provided a link so hopefully we can check out the most relevant ones in greater detail. I also left the link to the graph so we can keep exploring that. It's a really cool site!

Afterwards, I moved back to Unreal. I still cannot get the vehicle actor to be possessed at spawn. I can do it manually from the editor and have done some testing to make sure the vehicle itself works, and it does. It seems I don't have the correct grasp of the player controller. 


## Issues/Problems
- Don't know much about conference / paper submission. Tried my best to filter for the "best" conferences.
- I cannot get this rover to be possessed automatically.
