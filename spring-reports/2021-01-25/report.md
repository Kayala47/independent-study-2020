# Final Report - Fall 2020 Semester #

## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned ##
Concepts:
- Working with Unreal Engine
    - LOD and Materials
    - Movement and Cameras
    - Blueprints
- Creating Levels
    - Perlin noise generated maps
    - Transfer to Unreal Engine 4.25

Activities:
I started the semester just by learning about Unreal Engine. I spent time working with making new materials and 
objects, learning about Level Of Detail(LOD) mechanics and best practices for making hyper realistic environments. Part of that was learning about how to efficiently show realistic environments, and that hinged around only loading what is necessary.

In the picture above, see the difference between a LOD of 1, which renders when the camera is close to the object, versus a LOD 5 object, which is used when the camera is further. 

Then, I moved on to moving actors, including humanoid and rover forms. Moving the cameras and having them positioned and scripted correcly for 1st person views that were necessary to trianing the model was especially difficult. Here's what it looked like on the car model:

Finally, I moved onto working with Blueprints, since a large part of the work involved taking and organizing screenshots at appropriate points in the movement of the vehicle. I struggled with this because it was a very large environment with not-so-adequate documentation, but eventually was able to learn how to take these screenshots and later organize them with a script into a csv. 

The Blueprint ended up looking like this:

I used Rama's extension to add more nodes to the blueprint environment. These were absolutely essential, as Unreal doesn't support reading or writing to text files otherwise. 

Afterwards, I wrote a python script to organize the screenshots into a csv, labeled with the direction the rover was going at the time it was taken.

## Issues/Problems
- One of the recurring bugs I experienced was not enough space in my C drive, which Unreal Engine insisted on being installed in, even after I moved it to the larger F drive. Supporting files got installed there even if I pointed the installation wizard towards F:. It wasn't a huge deal, just a source of annoyance
- The largest setback was simply unfamiliarity with Unreal Engine, but I got over that ok. There are plenty of good youtube videos that you can watch to learn more. 
- Lastly, finding the library to read/write files was a huge breakthrough, but did take a lot of digging to find. 

## Plans for next semester
- The next essential step is being able to read a text file and generate a new world from it. For this, C++ is essential, so I'll be taking a crash course to learn the basics.
