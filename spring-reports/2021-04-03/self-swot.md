# Process
You will complete a “Self-SWOT” (see below), and either add it to your lab report or send me a DM on Slack. Don’t go to far overboard, I don’t want you to spend more than 10 to 20 minutes on this. I will also consider each question for you. We will then take a lab meeting for me to meet with each of you one-on-one. This will be a fairly informal process and the goal is to improve me as a mentor, you as a mentee, and the lab in general.


## Strengths
- good at learning on my own
- can produce well commented code
- (maybe) good report writing

## Weaknesses
- hesitant to ask for help
- self-confidence could use some work (some imposter syndrome creeps up every meeting)

## Opportunities:
- P-ai this semester
- Visa this summer (Machine Learning Research Team)


## Threats
- a little overwhelmed with schoolwork at times: have had some trouble focusing
- a little scared about implementing next steps: don't know how yet, and I can feel myself trying to put it off. I'll get it soon.

## Goals
- try to get more involved in the machine learning side of things.
    + I'd like to be able to get involved and learn how we're actually doing these things
- soon: finish my linear algebra course online
- be able to relax a little this summer
